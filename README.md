This project develops an interactive CRM sales dashboard for Maven Tech to provide visibility into team performance, pipeline health, and revenue trends across regions, managers, and sales agents.

The objective was to transform raw sales opportunity data into a decision-support tool that enables quarterly performance tracking, identification of bottlenecks, and account-level segmentation to improve sales efficiency and strategic planning.

The dashboard analyzes:

• Total closed revenue and win rate

• Average sales cycle length by agent

• Pipeline distribution by deal stage

• Average deal size by product

• Revenue contribution by product series

• Account characteristics (age, size, sector)

Interactive filters (year, quarter, region, manager, sales agent, product series, and product) allow stakeholders to dynamically explore performance patterns and drill down into specific teams or segments.

Key insights supported by the dashboard include identifying top- and underperforming agents, detecting stage-level bottlenecks in the pipeline, evaluating which products drive higher-value deals, and understanding which account profiles convert more efficiently.

The project also includes a structured data model and protected formula logic to ensure scalability and consistent KPI tracking as new sales data is added.

This analysis simulates a real-world CRM implementation scenario where sales operations, revenue management, and account segmentation are integrated into a centralized reporting system to support data-driven decision-making.
